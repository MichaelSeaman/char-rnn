# char-rnn

A Keras implementation of Andrej Karpathy's famous [RNN blog post](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/). These python scripts can be used to
  * Train a deep LSTM-RNN on textual data
  * Generate new data based on a seed
  * Visualize training growth


### Prerequisites

This repo is built in python3. The following frameworks are used:
  * NumPy
  * TensorFlow
  * Theano
  * Keras

With the following python modules:
  * sklearn
  * matplotlib

## Usage
To train a new RNN model on a text file TRAIN_FILE:
```
python3 rnn.py -t TRAIN_FILE -e NUM_EPOCHS
opts, args = getopt.getopt(argv, 't:e:cw:', ['trainFile=','epochs=','continue','weightsFile='])
for opt, arg in opts:
    if opt in ('-t', '--trainFile'):
        TRAIN_FILE = arg
    elif opt in ('-w', '--weightsFile'):
        WEIGHTS_FILE = arg
    elif opt in ('-e', '--epochs'):
        NUM_EPOCHS = int(arg)
    elif opt in ('-c', '--continue'):
        CONTINUE_FROM_PREV = True
```
In order to resume training from previous session, include the `-c` option and add `-w WEIGHTS_FILE` containing your previous weights file.
