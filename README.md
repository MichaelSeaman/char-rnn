# char-rnn

A Keras implementation of Andrej Karpathy's famous [RNN blog post](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/). These python scripts can be used to
  * Train a deep LSTM-RNN on textual data
  * Generate new data based on a seed
  * Visualize training growth


### Prerequisites

This repo is built in python3. The following frameworks are used:
  * NumPy
  * TensorFlow
  * Theano
  * Keras

With the following python modules:
  * sklearn
  * matplotlib

## Usage
To train a new RNN model on a text file TRAIN_FILE:
```
python3 rnn.py -i TRAIN_FILE -e NUM_EPOCHS
```
In order to resume training from previous session, include the `-c` option and add `-w WEIGHTS_FILE` containing your previous weights file.


## Files

```
rnn.py # Module for training library
generate.py # Module for generating arbitrary text
graph_training.py # Module for graphing the training history generated by rnn.py
callback.py # Helper function to generate text as training progresses.
```
